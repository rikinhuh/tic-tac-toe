Abstract



This project, Futuristic Tic-Tac-Toe Game, is a web-based two-player interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 The project aims to recreate the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a modern, futuristic neon-themed user interface.
 It allows two players to input names, play alternately, track their scores, and store data locally using browser LocalStorage, ensuring it works both offline and online.
 The project is simple, responsive, and ideal for understanding the fundamentals of frontend web development and user interaction design.







Introduction



Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet popular game that helps in understanding logical thinking and strategic gameplay.
 This project enhances the traditional game by providing a futuristic digital experience with neon effects and persistent scoring features.
 It is designed as a browser-based application, fully functional without an internet connection, and easily deployable using Netlify for online access.
Objectives

To design an interactive two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.


To implement score tracking and name customization.


To provide offline functionality using LocalStorage.


To create a modern futuristic user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


To host the project on Netlify for public accessibility.

Existing System

The existing Tic-Tac-Toe games available online are often basic in design or limited to single-player modes.
 Many do not provide persistent score tracking, or offline accessibility, and lack an appealing futuristic look.
 Our system enhances the gameplay experience with modern UI and additional features.
